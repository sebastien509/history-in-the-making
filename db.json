That's exactly what happened with the Code of Ur-Nammu. It's like when I tell my class to write the rules on the board, but WAY more permanent. This was humanity's first written legal code, and boy, did they take it seriously! No more 'but I didn't know that was against the rules' excuses after this one, folks!"

Some were pretty weird too, like 'If you build a house badly and it falls on someone, you get squished by a house too.' Talk about harsh detention policies!"

Their alphabet became so popular it eventually led to the one we're using right now. Talk about a trending topic that never went out of style!"
